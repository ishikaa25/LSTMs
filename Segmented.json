One day, Jack\u2019s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, \u201cWhat will you give me in return for my cow?\u201d The man answered, \u201cI will give you five magic beans!\u201d Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he reached home, Jack\u2019s mother was very angry. She said, \u201cYou fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!\u201d She threw the beans out of the window. Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.  The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack went inside the house and found the giant\u2019s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, \u201cCould you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!\u201d The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.  While he was eating, the giant came home. The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and went and hid inside. The giant cried, \u201cFee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I will grind his bones to make my bread!\u201d The wife said, \u201cThere is no boy in here!\u201d So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room. He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk. At home, he gave the coins to his mother. His mother was very happy and they lived well for sometime.  Jack and the Beanstalk Fee Fi Fo Fum!Climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant\u2019s house again. Once again, Jack asked the giant\u2019s wife for food, but while he was eating the giant returned. Jack leapt up in fright and went and hid under the bed. The giant cried, \u201cFee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I will grind his bones to make my bread!\u201d The wife said, \u201cThere is no boy in here!\u201d The giant ate his food and went to his room. There, he took out a hen. He shouted, \u201cLay!\u201d and the hen laid a golden egg. When the giant fell asleep, Jack took the hen and climbed down the beanstalk. Jack\u2019s mother was very happy with him.  After some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant\u2019s castle. For the third time, Jack met the giant\u2019s wife and asked for some food. Once again, the giant\u2019s wife gave him bread and milk. But while Jack was eating, the giant came home. \u201cFee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I will grind his bones to make my bread!\u201d cried the giant. \u201cdo not be silly! There is no boy in here!\u201d said his wife.  The giant had a magical harp that could play beautiful songs. While the giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about to leave. Suddenly, the magic harp cried, \u201cHelp master! A boy is stealing me!\u201d The giant woke up and saw Jack with the harp. Furious, he ran after Jack. But Jack was too fast for him. He ran down the beanstalk and reached home. The giant followed him down. Jack quickly ran inside his house and fetched an axe. He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and died.  Jack and his mother were now very rich and they lived happily ever after.","1":"Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.  One day her mother said to her, \"Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, do not forget to say, good-morning, and do not peep into every corner before you do it.\"  I will take great care, said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.  The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.  \"Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood,\" said he.  \"Thank you kindly, wolf.\"  \"Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?\"  \"To my grandmother's.\"  \"What have you got in your apron?\"  \"Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\"  \"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\"  \"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it,\" replied Little Red Riding Hood.  The wolf thought to himself, \"What a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\" So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, \"see Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round. I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.\"  Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay. That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time. And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.  Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door.  \"Who is there?\"  \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf. \"She is bringing cake and wine. Open the door.\"  \"Lift the latch,\" called out the grandmother, \"I am too weak, and cannot get up.\"  The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.  Little Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.  She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.  She called out, \"Good morning,\" but received no answer. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.  \"Oh, grandmother,\" she said, \"what big ears you have.\"  \"The better to hear you with, my child,\" was the reply.  \"But, grandmother, what big eyes you have,\" she said.  \"The better to see you with, my dear.\"  \"But, grandmother, what large hands you have.\"  \"The better to hug you with.\"  \"Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have.\"  \"The better to eat you with.\"  And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Little Red Riding Hood.  When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how the old woman is snoring. I must just see if she wants anything.  So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. \"Do I find you here, you old sinner,\" said he. \"I have long sought you.\"  Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.  When he had made two snips, he saw the Little Red Riding Hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, \"Ah, how frightened I have been. How dark it was inside the wolf.\"  And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Little Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.  Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf's skin and went home with it. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Little Red Riding Hood had brought, and revived, but Little Red Riding Hood thought to herself, as long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.  It is also related that once when Little Red Riding Hood was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Little Red Riding Hood, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. \"Well,\" said the grandmother, \"we will shut the door, that he may not come in.\"  Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried, \"open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red Riding Hood, and am bringing you some cakes.\"  But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Little Red Riding Hood went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child, take the pail, Little Red Riding Hood. I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough. Little Red Riding Hood carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Little Red Riding Hood went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.","2":"One day Henny-penny was picking up corn in the rickyard when\u2014whack!\u2014an acorn hit her upon the head. \"Goodness gracious me!\" said Henny-penny, \"the sky's a-going to fall; I must go and tell the King.\"  So she went along, and she went along, and she went along, till she met Cocky-locky. \"Where are you going, Henny-penny?\" says Cocky-locky. \"Oh! I am going to tell the King the sky's a-falling,\" says Henny-penny. \"May I come with you?\" says Cocky-locky. \"Certainly,\" says Henny-penny. So Henny-penny and Cocky-locky went to tell the King the sky was falling.  They went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Ducky-daddles. \"Where are you going to, Henny-penny and Cocky-locky?\" says Ducky-daddles. \"Oh! we are going to tell the King the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. \"May I come with you?\" says Ducky-daddles. \"Certainly,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, and Ducky-daddles went to tell the King the sky was a-falling.  So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Goosey-poosey. \"Where are you going to, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, and Ducky-daddles?\" said Goosey-poosey. \"Oh! we are going to tell the King the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles. \"May I come with you?\" said Goosey-poosey. \"Certainly,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, and Ducky-daddles. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey went to tell the King the sky was a-falling.  So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Turkey-lurkey. \"Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey?\" says Turkey-lurkey. \"Oh! we are going to tell the King the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey. \"May I come with you, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey?\" said Turkey-lurkey. \"Oh, certainly, Turkey-lurkey,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey all went to tell the King the sky was a-falling.  Henny-Penny: The Sky is Falling groupSo they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Foxy-woxy, and Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey, \"Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey?\" And Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey said to Foxy-woxy, \"we are going to tell the King the sky's a-falling.\" \"Oh! but this is not the way to the King, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey,\" says Foxy-woxy; \"I know the proper way; shall I show it you?\" \"Oh, certainly, Foxy-woxy,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, Turkey-lurkey, and Foxy-woxy all went to tell the King the sky was a-falling. So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they came to a narrow and dark hole. Now this was the door of Foxy-woxy's burrow. But Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddies, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey, \"This is the short cut to the King's palace: you will soon get there if you follow me. I will go first and you come after, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.\" \"Why, of course, certainly, without doubt, why not?\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.  So Foxy-woxy went into his burrow, and he did not go very far but turned round to wait for Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey. Now Turkey-lurkey was the first to go through the dark hole into the burrow. He had not got far when\u2014  \"Hrumph!\"  Foxy-woxy snapped off Turkey-lurkey's head and threw his body over his left shoulder. Then Goosey-poosey went in, and\u2014  \"Hrumph!\"  Henny-Penny: The Sky is Falling fowlOff went her head and Goosey-poosey was thrown beside Turkey-lurkey. Then Ducky-daddles waddled down, and\u2014  \"Hrumph!\"  Foxy-woxy had snapped off Ducky-daddles' head and Ducky-daddles was thrown alongside Turkey-lurkey and Goosey-poosey. Then Cocky-locky strutted down into the burrow, and he had not gone far when\u2014  \"Hrumph!\"  But Cocky-locky will always crow whether you want him to do so or not, and so he had just time for one \"Cock-a-doo-dle d\u2014\" before he went to join Turkey-lurkey, Goosey-poosey, and Ducky-daddles over Foxy-woxy's shoulders.  Now when Henny-penny, who had just got into the dark burrow, heard Cocky-locky crow, she said to herself:  \"My goodness! it must be dawn. Time for me to lay my egg.\"  So she turned round and bustled off to her nest; so she escaped, but she never told the King the sky was falling!","3":"Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and evening-- the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by dreadfully fast.  One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.  She crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little thing!  The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of that she thought.  In a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.  Her little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. \"Rischt!\" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.  She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's house.  Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when--the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire.  \"Someone is just dead!\" said the little girl; for her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.  She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an expression of love.  \"Grandmother!\" cried the little one. \"Oh, take me with you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!\" And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.  But in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. \"She wanted to warm herself,\" people said. No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a new year.","4":"There was once a woman who was very, very cheerful, though she had little to make her so; for she was old, and poor, and lonely. She lived in a little bit of a cottage and earned a scant living by running errands for her neighbours, getting a bite here, a sup there, as reward for her services. So she made shift to get on, and always looked as spry and cheery as if she had not a want in the world.  Now one summer evening, as she was trotting, full of smiles as ever, along the high road to her hovel, what should she see but a big black pot lying in the ditch!  \"Goodness me!\" she cried, \"that would be just the very thing for me if I only had something to put in it! But I have not! Now who could have left it in the ditch?\"  And she looked about her expecting the owner would not be far off; but she could see nobody.  \"Maybe there is a hole in it,\" she went on, \"and that is why it has been cast away. But it would do fine to put a flower in for my window; so I will just take it home with me.\"  And with that she lifted the lid and looked inside. \"Mercy me!\" she cried, fair amazed. \"If it is not full of gold pieces. here is luck!\"  And so it was, brimful of great gold coins. Well, at first she simply stood stock-still, wondering if she was standing on her head or her heels. Then she began saying:  \"Lawks! But I do feel rich. I feel awful rich!\"  After she had said this many times, she began to wonder how she was to get her treasure home. It was too heavy for her to carry, and she could see no better way than to tie the end of her shawl to it and drag it behind her like a go-cart.  \"It will soon be dark,\" she said to herself as she trotted along. \"So much the better! The neighbours will not see what I am bringing home, and I shall have all the night to myself, and be able to think what I will do! Mayhap I will buy a grand house and just sit by the fire with a cup of tea and do no work at all like a queen. Or maybe I will bury it at the garden foot and just keep a bit in the old china teapot on the chimney-piece. Or maybe\u2014Goody! Goody! I feel that grand I do not know myself.\"  By this time she was a bit tired of dragging such a heavy weight, and, stopping to rest a while, turned to look at her treasure.  And lo! it was not a pot of gold at all! It was nothing but a lump of silver.  She stared at it, and rubbed her eyes, and stared at it again.  \"Well! I never!\" she said at last. \"And me thinking it was a pot of gold! I must have been dreaming. But this is luck! Silver is far less trouble\u2014easier to mind, and not so easy stolen. Them gold pieces would have been the death of me, and with this great lump of silver\u2014\"  So she went off again planning what she would do, and feeling as rich as rich, until becoming a bit tired again she stopped to rest and gave a look round to see if her treasure was safe; and she saw nothing but a great lump of iron!  \"Well! I never!\" says she again. \"And I mistaking it for silver! I must have been dreaming. But this is luck! it is real convenient. I can get penny pieces for old iron, and penny pieces are a deal handier for me than your gold and silver. Why! I should never have slept a wink for fear of being robbed. But a penny piece comes in useful, and I shall sell that iron for a lot and be real rich\u2014rolling rich.\"  So on she trotted full of plans as to how she would spend her penny pieces, till once more she stopped to rest and looked round to see her treasure was safe. And this time she saw nothing but a big stone.  \"Well! I never!\" she cried, full of smiles. \"And to think I mistook it for iron. I must have been dreaming. But here is luck indeed, and me wanting a stone terrible bad to stick open the gate. Eh my! but it is a change for the better! it is a fine thing to have good luck.\"  So, all in a hurry to see how the stone would keep the gate open, she trotted off down the hill till she came to her own cottage. She unlatched the gate and then turned to unfasten her shawl from the stone which lay on the path behind her. Aye! It was a stone sure enough. There was plenty light to see it lying there, douce and peaceable as a stone should.  So she bent over it to unfasten the shawl end, when\u2014\"Oh my!\" All of a sudden it gave a jump, a squeal, and in one moment was as big as a haystack. Then it let down four great lanky legs and threw out two long ears, nourished a great long tail and romped off, kicking and squealing and whinnying and laughing like a naughty, mischievous boy!  The old woman stared after it till it was fairly out of sight, then she burst out laughing too.  \"Well!\" she chuckled, \"I am in luck! Quite the luckiest body hereabouts.

and went to sleep without dinner.","The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans!","He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky.","There lived a giant and his wife.","Jack went inside the house and found the giant\u2019s wife in the kitchen.","Jack said, \u201cCould you please give me something to eat?","I am so hungry!\u201d The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.","While he was eating, the giant came home.","The giant was very big and looked very fearsome.","Jack was terrified and went and hid inside.","The giant cried, \u201cFee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.","Be he alive, or be he dead, I will grind his bones to make my bread!\u201d The wife said, \u201cThere is no boy in here!\u201d So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room.","He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside.","Then he went to sleep.","In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk.","At home, he gave the coins to his mother.","His mother was very happy and they lived well for sometime.","Jack and the Beanstalk Fee Fi Fo Fum!Climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant\u2019s house again.","Once again, Jack asked the giant\u2019s wife for food, but while he was eating the giant returned.","Jack leapt up in fright and went and hid under the bed.","The giant cried, \u201cFee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.","Be he alive, or be he dead, I will grind his

laid a golden egg.","When the giant fell asleep, Jack took the hen and climbed down the beanstalk.","Jack\u2019s mother was very happy with him.","After some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant\u2019s castle.","For the third time, Jack met the giant\u2019s wife and asked for some food.","Once again, the giant\u2019s wife gave him bread and milk.","But while

her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child.","Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else.","So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.","One day her mother said to her, \"Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine.","Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good.","Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing.","And when you go into her room, do not forget to say, good-morning, and do not peep into every corner before you do it.\"","I will take great care, said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.","The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her.","Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.","\"Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood,\" said he.","\"Thank you kindly, wolf.\"","\"Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?\"","\"To my grandmother's.\"","\"What have you got in your apron?\"","\"Cake and wine.","Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\"","\"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\"","\"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood.","Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below.","You surely must know it,\" replied Little Red Riding Hood.","The wolf thought to himself, \"What a tender young creature.","What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman.","I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\"","So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, \"see Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here.","Why do you not look round.","I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing.","You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.\"","Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay.","That would please her too.","It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time.","And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.","And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.","Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door.","\"Who is there?\"","\"Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf.","\"She is bringing cake and wine.","Open the door.\"","\"Lift the latch,\" called out the grandmother, \"I am too weak, and cannot get up.\"","The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her.","Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.","Little Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.","She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.","She called out, \"Good morning,\" but received no answer.","So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.","There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.","\"Oh, grandmother,\" she said, \"what big ears you have.\"","\"The better to hear you with, my child,\" was the reply.","\"But, grandmother, what big eyes you have,\" she said.","\"The better to see you with, my dear.\"","\"But, grandmother, what large hands you have.\"","\"The better to hug you with.\"","\"Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have.\"","\"The better to eat you with.\"","And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Little Red Riding Hood.","When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.","The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how the old woman is snoring.","I must just see if she wants anything.","So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.","\"Do I find you here, you old sinner,\" said he.","\"I have long sought you.\"","Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.","When he had made two snips, he saw the Little Red Riding Hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, \"Ah, how frightened I have been.","How dark it was inside the wolf.\"","And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe.","Little Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.","Then all three were delighted.","The huntsman drew off the wolf's skin and went home with it.","The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Little Red Riding Hood had brought, and revived, but Little Red Riding Hood thought to herself, as long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.","It is also related that once when Little Red Riding Hood was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path.","Little Red Riding Hood, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up.","\"Well,\" said the grandmother, \"we will shut the door, that he may not come in.\"","Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried, \"open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red Riding Hood, and am bringing you some cakes.\"","But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Little Red Riding Hood went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness.","But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.","In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child, take the pail, Little Red Riding Hood.","I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.","Little Red Riding Hood carried until the great trough was quite full.","Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned.","But Little Red Riding Hood went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again."],"2":["One day Henny-penny was picking up corn in the rickyard when\u2014whack!\u2014an acorn hit her upon the head.","\"Goodness gracious me!\"","said Henny-penny, \"the sky's a-going to fall; I must go and tell the King.\"","So she went along, and she went along, and she went along, till she met Cocky-locky.","\"Where are you going, Henny-penny?\"","says Cocky-locky.","\"Oh!","I am going to tell the King the sky's a-falling,\" says Henny-penny.","\"May I come with you?\"","says Cocky-locky.","\"Certainly,\" says Henny-penny.","So Henny-penny and Cocky-locky went to tell the King the sky was falling.","They went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Ducky-daddles.","\"Where are you going to, Henny-penny and Cocky-locky?\"","says Ducky-daddles.","\"Oh!","we are going to tell the King the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky.","\"May I come with you?\"","says Ducky-daddles.","\"Certainly,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky.","So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, and Ducky-daddles went to tell the King the sky was a-falling.","So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Goosey-poosey.","\"Where are you going to, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, and Ducky-daddles?\"","said Goosey-poosey.","\"Oh!","we are going to tell the King the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles.","\"May I come with you?\"","said Goosey-poosey.","\"Certainly,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, and Ducky-daddles.","So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey went to tell the King the sky was a-falling.","So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Turkey-lurkey.","\"Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey?\"","says Turkey-lurkey.","\"Oh!","we are going to tell the King the sky's a-falling,\" said

a-falling.","Henny-Penny: The Sky is Falling groupSo they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Foxy-woxy, and Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey, \"Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey?\"","And Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and

Turkey-lurkey,\" says Foxy-woxy; \"I know the proper way; shall I show it you?\"","\"Oh, certainly, Foxy-woxy,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.","So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, Turkey-lurkey, and Foxy-woxy all went to tell the King the sky was a-falling.","So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they came to a narrow and dark hole.","Now this was the door of Foxy-woxy's burrow.","But Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddies, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey, \"This is the short cut to the King's palace: you will soon get there if you follow me.","I will go first and you come after, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and

did not go very far but turned round to wait for Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.","Now Turkey-lurkey was the first to go through the dark hole into the burrow.","He had not got far when\u2014  \"Hrumph!\"","Foxy-woxy snapped off Turkey-lurkey's head and threw his body over his left shoulder.","Then Goosey-poosey went in, and\u2014  \"Hrumph!\"","Henny-Penny: The Sky is Falling fowlOff went her head and Goosey-poosey was thrown beside Turkey-lurkey.","Then Ducky-daddles waddled down, and\u2014  \"Hrumph!\"","Foxy-woxy had snapped off Ducky-daddles' head and Ducky-daddles was thrown alongside Turkey-lurkey and Goosey-poosey.","Then Cocky-locky strutted down into the burrow, and he had not gone far when\u2014  \"Hrumph!\"","But

over Foxy-woxy's shoulders.","Now when Henny-penny, who had just got into the dark burrow, heard Cocky-locky crow, she said to herself:  \"My goodness!","it must be dawn.","Time for me to lay my egg.\"","So she turned round and bustled off to her nest; so she escaped, but she never told the King the sky was falling!"],"3":["Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and evening-- the last evening of the year.","In this cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked feet.","When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the good of that?","They were very large slippers, which her mother had hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by dreadfully fast.","One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself.","So the little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue from cold.","She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a bundle of them in her hand.","Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.","She crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little thing!","The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought.","From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of that she thought.","In a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she seated herself down and cowered together.","Her little feet she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.","Her little hands were almost numbed with cold.","Oh!","a match might afford her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it.","She drew one out.","\"Rischt!\"","how it blazed, how it burnt!","It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light.","It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top.","The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully.","The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.","She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room.","On the table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums.","And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind.","She lighted another match.","Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's house.","Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her.","The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when--the match went out.","The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire.","\"Someone is just dead!\"","said the little girl; for her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.","She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an expression of love.","\"Grandmother!\"","cried the little one.","\"Oh, take me with you!","You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!\"","And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her.","And the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall.","She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.","But in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last evening of the old year.","Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt.","\"She wanted to warm herself,\" people said.","No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a new year."],"4":["There was once a woman who was very, very cheerful, though she had little to make her so; for she was old, and poor, and lonely.","She lived in a little bit of a cottage and earned a scant living by running errands for her neighbours, getting a bite here, a sup there, as reward for her services.","So she made shift to get on, and always looked as spry and cheery as if she had not a want in the world.","Now one summer evening, as she was trotting, full of smiles as ever, along the high road to her hovel, what should she see but a big black pot lying in the ditch!","\"Goodness me!\"","she cried, \"that would be just the very thing for me if I only had something to put in it!","But I have not!","Now who could have left it in the ditch?\"","And she looked about her expecting the owner would not be far off; but she could see nobody.","\"Maybe there is a hole in it,\" she went on, \"and that is why it has been cast away.","But it would do fine to put a flower in for my window; so I will just take it home with me.\"","And with that she lifted the lid and looked inside.","\"Mercy me!\"","she cried, fair amazed.","\"If it is not full of gold pieces.","here is luck!\"","And so it was, brimful of great gold coins.","Well, at first she simply stood stock-still, wondering if she was standing on her head or her heels.","Then she began saying:  \"Lawks!","But I do feel rich.","I feel awful rich!\"","After she had said this many times, she began to wonder how she was to get her treasure home.","It was too heavy for her to carry, and she could see no better way than to tie the end of her shawl to it and drag it behind her like a go-cart.","\"It will soon be dark,\" she said to herself as she trotted along.","\"So much the better!","The neighbours will not see what I am bringing home, and I shall have all the night to myself, and be able to think what I will do!","Mayhap I will buy a grand house and just sit by the fire with a cup of tea and do no work at all like a queen.","Or maybe I will bury it at the garden foot and just keep a bit in the old china teapot on the chimney-piece.","Or maybe\u2014Goody!","Goody!","I feel that grand I do not know myself.\"","By this time she was a bit tired of dragging such a heavy weight, and, stopping to rest a while, turned to look at her treasure.","And lo!","it was not a pot of gold at all!","It was nothing but a lump of silver.","She stared at it, and rubbed her eyes, and stared at it again.","\"Well!","I never!\"","she said at last.","\"And me thinking it was a pot of gold!","I must have been dreaming.","But this is luck!","Silver is far less trouble\u2014easier to mind, and not so easy stolen.","Them gold pieces would have been the death of me, and with this great lump of silver\u2014\"  So she went off again planning what she would do, and feeling as rich as rich, until becoming a bit tired again she stopped to rest and gave a look round to see if her treasure was safe; and she saw nothing but a great lump of iron!","\"Well!","I never!\"","says she again.","\"And I mistaking it for silver!","I must have been dreaming.","But this is luck!","it is real convenient.","I can get penny pieces for old iron, and penny pieces are a deal handier for me than your gold and silver.","Why!","I should never have slept a wink for fear of being robbed.","But a penny piece comes in useful, and I shall sell that iron for a lot and be real rich\u2014rolling rich.\"","So on she trotted full of plans as to how she would spend her penny pieces, till once more she stopped to rest and looked round to see her treasure was safe.","And this time she saw nothing but a big stone.","\"Well!","I never!\"","she cried, full of smiles.","\"And to think I mistook it for iron.","I must have been dreaming.","But here is luck indeed, and me wanting a stone terrible bad to stick open the gate.","Eh my!","but it is a change for the better!","it is a fine thing to have good luck.\"","So, all in a hurry to see how the stone would keep the gate open, she trotted off down the hill till she came to her own cottage.","She unlatched the gate and then turned to unfasten her shawl from the stone which lay on the path behind her.","Aye!","It was a stone sure enough.","There was plenty light to see it lying there, douce and peaceable as a stone should.","So she bent over it to unfasten the shawl end, when\u2014\"Oh my!\"","All of a sudden it gave a jump, a squeal, and in one moment was as big as a haystack.","Then it let down four great lanky legs and threw out two long ears, nourished a great long tail and romped off, kicking and squealing and whinnying and laughing like a naughty, mischievous boy!","The old woman stared after it till it was fairly out of sight, then she burst out laughing too.","\"Well!\"","she chuckled, \"I am in luck!","Quite the luckiest body hereabouts.","Fancy my seeing the Bogey-Beast all to myself; and making myself so free with it too!","My goodness!","I do feel that uplifted\u2014that GRAND!","\"\u2014  So she went into her cottage and spent the evening chuckling over her good luck."]}}
